# Momentum Trading Strategies in Equity Markets

## Abstract
This paper examines momentum-based trading strategies across various equity markets. We analyze the performance of strategies based on 12-month price momentum and demonstrate consistent alpha generation.

## Key Findings
- 12-month momentum strategies generate significant positive returns
- Winner portfolios outperform loser portfolios by 1-2% monthly
- Performance persists across different market conditions
- Transaction costs can erode returns significantly

## Implementation
- Sort stocks by 12-month trailing returns
- Long top decile, short bottom decile
- Monthly rebalancing recommended
- Risk management via position sizing crucial

## Risk Factors
- Mean reversion risk during market reversals
- Liquidity constraints in smaller cap stocks
- Concentration risk in sector-specific momentum
- Volatility clustering increases drawdown risk

## Conclusion
Momentum strategies remain viable when properly implemented with robust risk controls and cost management.
