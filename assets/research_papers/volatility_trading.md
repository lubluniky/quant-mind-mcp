# Volatility Trading and Options Strategies

## Abstract
This research examines systematic volatility trading approaches including variance risk premium capture and delta-neutral options strategies.

## Variance Risk Premium

- VIX futures and ETF products enable access
- Mean reversion in volatility levels

## Strategy Types

### Short Volatility
- Selling out-of-money options
- Collecting premium systematically
- Tail risk management critical
- Position sizing based on vol regime

### Long Volatility
- Protective puts during low vol regimes
- Gamma scalping for market makers
- Dispersion trading opportunities
- Crisis alpha generation

### Vol Arbitrage
- Relative value between implied and realized
- Term structure trades
- Inter-market volatility spreads
- Correlation trading

## Risk Considerations
- Black swan events can cause severe losses
- Leverage amplifies tail risks
- Liquidity risk during market stress
- Model risk in volatility forecasting

## Implementation Guidelines
- Dynamic position sizing based on VIX levels
- Diversify across strikes and expirations
- Implement circuit breakers for risk events
- Maintain adequate capital reserves

## Conclusion
Volatility trading offers attractive risk-adjusted returns but requires sophisticated risk management and crisis protocols.
